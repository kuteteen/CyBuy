# CyBuy
Purchase outdated Cydia tweaks by identifying as different hardware and software to the Cydia Store.

## Info
CyBuy allows you to purchase Cydia tweaks on versions of iOS and iOS hardware not marked as supported for your current device. This tweak does not and can not enable piracy, but we still strongly advise against trying to tweak it in ways that might achieve this goal.

## Binaries
Because of the dangerous nature of this tweak, and the possibility of purchasing software that does not work on your devices, I will not be providing binaries for this. If you want it bad enough, you'll have to either compile it or scrounge around for a pre-compiled binary.
